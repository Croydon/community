## Intro to Bincrafters ##

The Bincrafters team builds binary software packages for the OSS community.  This is our repository for documentation and managing package issues with the community.  To read more about Bincrafters, please visit [our blog](https://bincrafters.github.io).

Our packages are generously hosted by Bintray:

## Using this Repository ##

### Issues ###
If you have an issue with a Bincrafters package, please report it on the [Github Issues](https://github.com/bincrafters/community/issues) page of this repository.  

### Wiki ###
Our wiki contains helpful documents for using our packages and using Conan in general.  It contains guidelines that we use for our own packages, but they can be applied to any package. 

### Other Bincrafters Repositories ###
If you submit a PR to another Bincrafters repository, please open an issue here to ensure we see it.  We are working on a way to streamline the notification process so that this happens automatically, but Github doesn't have native support for this workflow so we have to engineer it ourselves.
